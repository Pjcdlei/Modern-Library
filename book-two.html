        <br>
        “Fierce, feminist, and packed with funny anecdotes.”—Entertainment Weekly
      <br>

      NAMED ONE OF FALL’S MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS BY Time • Vox • USA Today • HuffPost • Bustle • Vogue • PopSugar • BookRiot • Shondaland
      <br>
      <br>
      In her hit Netflix comedy special Baby Cobra, an eight-month pregnant Ali Wong resonated so strongly that she even became a popular Halloween costume. Wong told the world her remarkably unfiltered thoughts on marriage, sex, Asian culture, working women, and why you never see new mom comics on stage but you sure see plenty of new dads.

              <br>
              Well, let’s just get right to it: I dated a series of men who had issues getting it up. It felt like a curse. Five guys in a row lost their boners in the middle of getting busy. Part of me blamed the Raynaud’s disease, a condition that was passed on to me by my father. I have extremely poor circulation to my hands and feet, to the point where in the cold, they will turn blue and feel like pain icicles.
